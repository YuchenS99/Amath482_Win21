# Amath482_Win21
UW Course - AMATH 482: Computational Methods For Data Analysis. Taught by Jason Bramburger.
The five assignments (reports) respectively explore the following topics:
1. Fourier Transform: Apply FFT, noise filtering and averaging to solve an ultrasound tracking problem.
2. Gábor Transforms: Explore the concept of Gábor transforms, and apply different windows/filters to produce spectrograms of music notes.
3. Principal Component Analysis: Practice with SVD and PCA on multiple videos to track the path of a bucket.
4. Digit Classification：Use SVD, PCA, and LDA (linear discriminant analysis) to do digit classification.
5. Background Subtraction in Video Streams：Explore the basic mechanism of Dynamic Mode Decomposition to subtract the background and moving objects in two videos.
